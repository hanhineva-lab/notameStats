object}

\item{y}{character, column name in pheno data of the target variable}

\item{id}{character, column name in pheno data of the subject ID variable in 
case of repeated measurements}

\item{multi_level}{logical, whether multi-level modeling should be applied, 
see Details}

\item{multi_level_var}{character, column name in pheno data of the variable 
for splitting the data in multi-level modeling}

pheno data to use as covariates in the model, in addition to molecular 
features. 
\code{static_covariates} are ignored for non-multi-level models.
For multi-level models, the change in \code{covariates} is computed, while
\code{static_covariates} are taken from the first time point.}

if FALSE, flagged features are left out}

\item{nInner}{Number of inner CV loop segments, parameter of MUVR}

\item{varRatio}{Ratio of variables to include in subsequent inner loop 
iteration, parameter of MUVR}

\description{
A wrapper around \code{\link[MUVR2]{MUVR2}} (random forest,
PLS(-DA)) and \code{\link[MUVR2]{MUVR2_EN}} (elastic net)
functions from the MUVR2 package.
}
\details{
This function is now using the MUVR2 package, characterized as an 
upgrade extending the original MUVR package by the inclusion of elastic net 
regression (EN) and some functionality not covered by this wrapper. Elastic 
net regression supports covariate adjustment by suppressing regularization 
of specified features from the regularization procedure. Note that this is 
different from simply including covariates such as sex. EN also differs from 
PLS and RF in that no recursive variable elimination is performed, so an 
additional scheme is used to obtain the 'min', 'mid' and 'max' models using
\code{\link[MUVR2]{getVar}}. 

Sex would be entered as a static covariate, since the change in sex is zero 
for all individuals, so computing the change and using that as a covariate 
does not make sense.

Note that there are several more plots available in MUVR2 for inspecting the 
results, notably \code{\link[MUVR2]{plotMV}}, 
\code{\link[MUVR2]{plotStability}} and \code{\link[MUVR2]{plotVIRank}}
Many of these return different plots depending on the model specification.
